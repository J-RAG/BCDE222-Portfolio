Currently::

	Testing
DONE>>	15. Must show time taken to beat level
	Testing extras
ADDED>> Test Constructor >> DONE
REMOVED >> Mock Stopwatch Class
	>> IStopWatch
MOVED >> MoveIsValid() method to Class Moves 

TODO NEXT >>>
	Transfer move methods to Coords Boject class. 
	Finish Class Diagram
	Finish Presentation Slides
Notes: 
	-Found a way to test StopWatch functoinality without using a mock stopwatch
	- Added testing for Game Constructor to demonstrate the Game Class Initial Build works
	
Problems:
	- Discussed with tudor About the Moves Class. Not considered a class and reccomended to place move methods into Coord Object Class. 
	- Requires another rebuild on the solution, will have to make another iteration.
